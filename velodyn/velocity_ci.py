"""Generate confidence intervals for RNA velocity models by bootstrapping
across reads.

Our bootstrapping procedure is as follows:

1. Given a spliced count matrix ([Cells, Genes]) S and an unspliced matrix U,
create a total counts matrix X = S + U.
2.1 For each cell X_i \in X, fit a multinomial distribution. Sample D (depth) reads
from each multinomial to create a sampled count distribution across genes \hat X_i.
2.2 For each gene g in \hat X_i, fit a binomial distribution Binom(n=\hat X_ig, p=\frac{S_ig}{X_ig})
which represents the distribution of spliced vs. unspliced counts.
2.3 Sample an estimate of the spliced counts for X_ig, \hat S_ig ~ Binom(n=X_ig, p=S_ig/X_ig).
Compute the conjugate unspliced read count \hat U_ig = \hat X_ig - \hat S_ig.
3. Given the complete bootstrapped samples \hat S, \hat U, estimate a bootstrapped
velocity vector for consideration.

Bootstrap samples of cell counts therefore have the same number of counts as the original
cell, preventing any issues due to differing library depths:

    \sum_i \sum_j X_{ij} \equiv \sum_i \sum_j \hat X_{ij}

        matrices in `.layers` as "spliced", "unspliced", "ambiguous".
        `.X` should contain raw count values, rather than transformed

    S : np.ndarray
        [Cells, Genes] spliced read counts.
    U : np.ndarray
        [Cells, Genes] unspliced read counts.
    A : np.ndarray
        [Cells, Genes] ambiguous read counts.

    Methods
    -------
    _sample_abundance_profile(x)
        sample a total read count vector from a multinomial fit
        to the observed count vector `x`.
    _sample_spliced_unspliced(s, u, a, x_hat)
        sample spliced, unspliced, and ambiguous read counts from
        a multinomial given a sample of total read counts `x_hat`
        and observed `s`pliced, `u`nspliced, `a`mbigious counts.
    _sample_matrices()
        samples a matrix of spliced, unspliced and ambiguous read
        counts for all cells and genes in `.adata`.
    _fit_velocity(SUA_hat,)
        fits a velocity model to sampled spliced, unspliced counts
        in an output from `_sample_matrices()`
    bootstrap_velocity(n_iter, embed)
        generate bootstrap samples of RNA velocity estimates using
        `_sample_matrices` and `_fit_velocity` sequentially.

    Notes
    -----
    Parallelization requires use of shared ctypes to avoid copying our
    large data arrays for each child process. See `_sample_matrices` for
    a discussion of the relevant considerations and solutions.
    Due to this issue, we have modified `__getstate__` such that pickling
    this object will not preserve all of the relevant data.

        Notes
        -----
        `_sample_matrices` uses `multiprocessing` to parallelize
        bootstrap simulations. We run into a somewhat tricky issue
        do to the size of our source data arrays (`.X, .S, .U, .A`).
        The usual approach to launching multiple processes is to use
        a `multiprocessing.Pool` to launch child processes, then copy
        the relevant data to each process by passing it as arguments 
        or through pickling of object attributes.

        Here, the size of our arrays means that copying the large matrices
        to memory for each child process is (1) memory prohibitive and 
        (2) really, really slow, defeating the whole purpose of parallelization.

        Here, we've implemented a batch processing solution to preserve RAM.
        We also use shared ctype arrays to avoid copying memory across workers.
        Use of ctype arrays increases the performance by ~5-fold. From this, we
        infer that copying even just the minibatch count arrays across all the 
        child processes is prohibitively expensive.

        We can create shared ctype arrays using `multiprocessing.sharedctypes` 
        that allow child processes to reference a single copy of each 
        relevant array in memory.
        Because these data are read-only, we can get away with using
        `multiprocessing.RawArray` since we don't need process synchronization 
        locks or any other sophisticated synchronization.

        Using `RawArray` with child processes in a pool is a little strange.
        We can't pass the `RawArray` pointer through a pickle, so we have to
        declare the pointers as global variables that get inherited by each
        child process through use of an `initializer` function in the pool.
        We also have to ensure that our parent object `__getstate__` function
        doesn't contain any of these large arrays, so that they aren't 
        accidently pickled in with the class methods. To fix that, we modify
        `__getstate__` above to remove large attributes from the object dict.
